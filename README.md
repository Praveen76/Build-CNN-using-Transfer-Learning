# Build CNN using Transfer Learning

## Introduction

A powerful and widely-used approach to deep learning on small image datasets is leveraging pre-trained models. When the original dataset is sufficiently large and diverse, the features learned by a pre-trained model can serve as a generic representation of the visual world. These features can prove beneficial for various computer vision problems, even when dealing with different classes than those in the original task.

There are two primary methods for utilizing a pre-trained model:

1. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract meaningful features from the pre-trained model, freezing its weights, and using these features as input for a new classifier.

2. **Fine-Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the top layers of the pre-trained model to adapt it to the specific characteristics of the new dataset.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

- **Understand and Use a Pre-trained Model:**
    - Gain knowledge of using pre-trained models and extracting meaningful features from them.

- **Fine-tune the Top Layers:**
    - Learn the process of fine-tuning the top layers of a pre-trained model to adapt it for a specific image classification task.

## Files Contained in the Project:
